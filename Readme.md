Fake news detection Project

We call Fake News here a News that contains Sarcasm.

In the aim to detect which News on the internet is real or fake, I developped this project using Python Language on Jupyter Notebook Platform. 

We used a Classification model based on the Passive Aggressive Classifier.
With parameters like the max_iteration fixed at 50.
